Hooters has never impressed me as far as customer service....wings are the best thing they have going! They should stay open later, it's by the beach, jeeeeeez! Great view, sit outside if you can.When in Clearwater you have to go to Hooter's at least once. Why you ask. Because its the original. The first Hooter's. WooHoo!  Their wings are ok I like the buffalo shrimp and  crab legs. Great place to see a football game and some jugs. Just kidding no I'm not.Other than the parking (there is none), everything was great! Service was fast and friendly. The food was great! The best part about this Hooters is the outside deck. You get a great view of the beach and the roundabout. Awesome for people watching.Terrible.... The only good thing that happened at our visit was the hostess staff was very quick and friendly.... Everything else was awful. Our server got our orders and brought us our food and then we didn't see her again. Our boneless wings that 3 out of 4 people ordered were so overcooked that they were too dry to eat. Had to take a drink to get them to go down. Tried to wave down other servers since ours disappeared and were completely ignored. When our server FINALLY came to check in we told her that the wings are too dry go eat. She asked if we wanted extra sauce. I explained no, we don't they are over cooked. She responded with \\\"I'm sorry. I dont like the boneless wings, only the kind he is eating\\\" pointing to our son who had bone in... I explained it wasn't her fault and apparently that was her que to walk away and disappear again. 15 minutes later while we sat over plates full of inedible chicken she brings us our 55$ check. Most expensive 55$ I have ever spent to leave a restaurant and still be hungry. It's too bad they don't train their servers better or take more pride in their place of business. It really is a nice atmosphere especially if eating outside. We will never return.Hooters has been around for a while, right?  Pioneers in the chicken Wing business, Right?  So, why are you all so behind the times?????  Social media has got to have you all trying bigger and better things to keep your employees and customers.  \\nTake Yelp, for instance, A great way to let everyone know about the establishment you experienced, correct?  If your server does a good enough job that your customer gave you a good report, REWARD THAT SERVER!  $20.....!  If you get a bad review,  and the server is called out for it, DOCK that server!! $10....?  This is a sure way to give and get good service and customers.....  \\n\\nThis Saturday, I took a few of my workers into the Hooters on Clearwater beach for lunch.  Our server was Sarah, a 19 year old motorcycle enthusiast that had a great attitude, smiled, and served us well.  I asked her if Hooters rewards good Yelp reviews and she said, no.  How unfair is that??  If your going to exploit these girls by making them wear what you want them to wear, at least reward them when they make you look good!  Is this not fair?????\\n\\nSo, please know that this experience was a great one, but only because of Sarah and your day shift manager, Todd Witkoski.  I will not write another good review until you people get caught up with the times.  This is not my FATHER's HOOTERS......Is it??\\n\\nI will, however, keep you all honest and report anything that is not good.  So, do you see how this can benefit your company.  try incentive.  It works!Stopped by for lunch while doing a \\\"at the beach\\\" Sunday. Had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, and it was good. Girlfriend had the Bleu Cheese Burger... and she really liked it (a lot). Fries were ok, Pickles were awesome! Service was good, although we had to hunt down a different waitress to bring us a check. Only complaint was that some bubba came in, and requested Nascar on all the TV's near us, blah! Formula One.. hell, yea, but roundy-round.... whatever!  (and for the haters... this is HOOTERS... not known as a fine dining establishment, right? Just typical bar food usually done fairly well! And HOOTERS!  :))This was my first visit to a hooters restaurant. I heard their food was very good, yet the wings and their buffalo chicken sandwich were overly greasy. We also had the fried pickles, which were okay but definitely did not live up to the standards I was expecting.To start I made a reservation 30 minutes prior to us heading to the restaurant through the open table app. When we arrived the hostess told me she had never paid attention to the screen and didnt know there was a reservation there. Then she got her manager and the guy was extremely nice and gave me options to sit my big group. (10) We ordered our food and drinks, our waitress was not friendly and she was very short. When she would go to her other tables, she would joke around, smile and play with them. Our appetizer was wrong, when she brought the right one out, she brought her manager with her. The second time she asked if our food was good, we let her know our food didnt tare like ANYTHING!!! The wings wete fresh but didnt have any kind of taste besides oil. She seemed to be afraid of us telling her something but we were friendly and patient. She kept bringing her manager with her without us asking her. The managers are amazing and know how to treat their customers. They need to learn how to make sure their servers know how to take care of their customers and show a little more friendliness regardless of race, party size or conplains. She seemed to not be patient with our kids at all, she was bothered every single time we asked for something. At the end of the day, it's their job, juat like we might not like our jobs sometimes. Overall, I would stay away from this place and just try something local, might run with better luck.Went up to the third floor to get a good view, didn't see a hostess so I found a server and asked if we seat ourselves, she said yes. We sat at the table for 15 MINUTES before anyone even acknowledged or greeted our table, saw 2 servers just walk by our table at least twice each (it was not that busy to have to wait so long) finally put our food and drink order in all at once when the waitress finally came to our table; waters came, food came, but didn't get my beer until she came to refill waters.. \\n Ordered nachos and mild wings they were not good: wings were over cooked and the guac on the nachos was already going bad. I've worked in lots of restaurants and the guac looking like that would have never left the kitchen.. Overall- service was awful, food didn't make up for the service, but the view was nice.I never give one star. I was never told of last call. Caight my waitress in the bathroom texting. Didnt even wash her hands after. I was still eating when they tried to rush us out ans began to clean. After cleaning i watched the bartender climb onto a bar in her dirtybar shows. Not only talk about rude, but disgusting. I cant even. Oh did i mention they barely even remembered to bring our check and when they did they handed it to me instead of the gentleman i was with and reached over his food and tried to box up my empty crabshells?  Done. Done. Done. All i have to say to the 5 star people is cool story bro!Best Server Experience....We visited Clearwater Beach and never went to the Hooters on Mandaly, so we made it a first time experience. Allison greeted us with a smile, asked us if we were from here and contiinued to speak with us, which was a great experience prior to eating our food. Not only was she friendly but she was on top of her game, getting our food out quickly and cleaning our table as soon as we were done. I would highly recommend Hooters at Clearwater Beach and ask for AllisonUsed to love and recommend The Lookout (https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Lookout-above-Hooters-on-Clearwater-Beach-Florida/526734577342827) to all our friends, but this past weekend we took our out of town friends in and we received no service, after 10-12 mins of sitting down and staring at the the staff, who were all huddled in one corner, they saw us but not one waitress would walk over, so we walked out. \\n\\nAvoid The LookOut.Hi Leah. Nice touch. Reached out to me to discuss and then never responded to my ask. Looks to the world like you careService was bad.  Took over 45 minutes to get our food.  The place was not busy.  The chicken was dry and the tots were cold.  We saw our waitress one time during the meal.  Do not recommend.The Hooters standards just seem to be dropping at all of them I goto! I grew up with the Original on Gulf to Bay in Clearwater and they are all falling way short! This is has a great view and that's about it!Hooters, wings, beer, with a view of the beach. Who needs anything else?Don't go to this hooters, the food is the worse.\\nI had a burger which was tasteless, my girlfriend had cold wings. Wait time 45+ minutes.\\nStill going to hooters but not this one.Ok, With an extremely heavy heart, I am writing this review.\\nHooters has been my all time favorite American restaurant since ages. I mean it. But the experience I had at this franchise of Hooters was utterly disgusting and sad.\\nNot only that I had to face RACIST behaviour but also the service and meal quality was compromised.\\nI want to quote that I took my family to Hooters while we were holidaying in Clearwater Beach. They were already thrilled after hearing such good stuff about the place. \\nThe entrance was just like another Hooters, warm and entertaining. We chose our table on the rooftop to enjoy the view of the beach. Our server's name was SAUNDRA. She took the order of 2 burger meals with drinks and one vegan cheese salad.\\nWhat happened later is a sad state. She disappeared for the next 20-25 mins and when she was asked about the time of the order, she made a frown with \\\"I dont know\\\" expression and left. She was so rude and condescending. Again, we realised that she is happy serving the BIGGG party happening right next to our table. \\nAnother party got disgusted with her attitude and late service and called the Manager who later apologised.\\nWe were given wrong meals and she disagreed to it. When came to the point of asking for check., she made a sad face and tried to explain her story of inapt behaviour. I cannot buy that.\\nShe spoilt the mood of my meal and bought us negative energy.\\nHave a good luck!Great food in a great atmosphere! The service was outstanding. What could be better than sitting on the balcony in Clearwater Beach, eating wings and watching football!This newer Hooters on Clearwater Beach is across from Pier 60 Park. The rooftop Lookout bar is spacious,beautiful,comfortable and a great place to take in the views,a sunset or just hang out and listen to the live music. \\nI'm not a fan of chicken wings,so I ordered the burger. It was massive & cooked perfectly.\\nAnd yes, the girls are cute,too....Decent place went here to enjoy new years eve, cool looking place and great location! location location location . . .How do you mess up an Ubereats order that has everything typed up neatly for you to read? I understand jobs are hard blah blah and people are busy but when a restaurant is going to charge $25 for wings then they better get their orders right. I highly recommend for tourists to visit the smaller family owned restaurants here in Dunedin and Clearwater. For wings, the best are at Dunedin Brewery, and you can get homemade beer with your meal!!The Worst Hooters visit in my lifetime! It starts off with getting Cherish as our server. I order my beer,  an order of Cheese Sticks and our wings. First our wings come and put on the table and cherish then disappears. Needless to say, I'm sitting there with nothing to drink. 10 minutes later I ask some on for help. Here comes cherish carrying my warm cup of beer, but no Cheese sticks. She then disappears again, then returns and ask us if we still want the cheese sticks. I'm like \\\"Really\\\"? Yes! 10 mins here comes our sticks! While we are eating our wings and sticks and I'm drinking my warm cup of SAMs Adams, Cherish comes over to ask is we will be having dessert or will that be all? Mind you I haven't even gotten 5 wings and half of my warm piss down at this time. We say NO! And out comes the check! It states $28.85 then after giving her my card, she comes back with a card slip for $38.02! Now I'm no rocket scientist, but I smell a Rat! She goes on to tell me that the bill she gave me was the old bill and the new total was $38.02. Well that's what she got,  and No Tip! See ya and I will never visit again.Love most Hooters.. this location isn't very friendly. We asked why the kitchen cooks had beard nets on that we saw in the window area but they were around their necks. Our server said that they didn't look good did they? Then we asked if the buffalo chicken salad was supposed to have buffalo sauce on the chicken and she told us buffalo meant chicken breast with plain breading. Then she flounced away rolling her eyes and discussed our whole beard question and buffalo sauce question within our earshot. Don't think we will be back to this location!!The food was on par for Hooters, not great but not bad either. (But really who goes to Hooters for the food?!) The service was excellent! We had a waitress who really took her time to make sure we had everything we needed. The view wasn't bad. The price wasn't too bad either.Great food but bartender was horrible (alyssa).. very rude and condescending. \\nThe manager does not pay any attention to the bartenders,  he came into the bar area twice and just seemed to giggle and flirt with the girls. \\n\\nWorst bartender ever,  but again the wings and pickles were excellent.Our bartender  Alyssa was terrible. She seemed like she didn't like us right off the bat. The first question i asked her was what she thought would be a good drink because that's what i usually do when i go to a new bar for the first time...she didnt seem very happy with my question and told me that she didnt drink....im not sure if she was lying because she didnt want to recommend anything but ill give her the benefit of the doubt and assume that she really doesnt drink. Why would u put someone behind the bar that doesn't drink and doesn't like to recommend drinks?!\\nIt doesn't make sense. She wasn't very social which made me think how she got this job but it all became very clear when a supervisor walked behind the bar and all of a sudden her attitude completely changed. \\nShe started giggling and what not....how about you take some of the good energy and use it on costumers?!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThen I asked her if she was a local and what places were good and she got pretty upset about that as well... i even saw her sometimes talking to her co workers and they would look at us and laugh....however, she did recommend a few places....\\n\\nThen I asked her what food she would recommend and she snapped and said why don't u just order what u want? !....I'm not making this up as outrageous as it sounds. \\n\\nLook....I don't know this girl and she might be a very nice person to shine people buy in this industry u treat everyone nice and u don't get to pick favorites. That's part of your job. She was one of the most unprofessional bartenders I've ever encountered which is unusual because hooters is usually a fun place.\\n\\nI ended up ordering boneless wings and the fried pickles...the food was really good but I can't get over the fact how mean and unprofessional the bartender was that's why I give this place 1 starTypical Hooters, but in a great new beach location.  From the second floor outdoor deck you get great sunsets and people-watching.  This is a fun place.  However, parking (especially free parking) is pretty limited.The WORST service I have ever received!!! My boyfriend and I stopped in for lunch after a day on the beach and wanted something familiar, so we came here. What a mistake! Our server ignored and avoided us the entire time, we had to go out of our way to grab her attention way too many times. What put the cherry on top, is when my boyfriend ordered a Stella, he sent it back twice because it didn't taste anything like it. He finally asked to have it taken away and removed from the bill with our check to go. Our waitress was gone for a solid 20 minutes and no where to be seen. There was about 15 girls on duty, all just standing around... we asked maybe 3 where our server was and nobody knew. Finally she came back to our table and immediately snapped an attitude on us like we are bothering her, I couldn't believe it!! When we finally got up to leave we passed maybe 10 girls on staff, not one said goodbye or anything but  did gave us scowls like we were problem customers. Unreal! Im so glad I didn't buy the souvenir cup for my Pina colda bc I don't want to be reminded of this place and will never return!We had just eaten dinner somewhere else, but went looking for a place to have a drink with a water view.  This Hooters fit the bill. \\n\\nWe went to their \\\"lookout\\\" on the top floor.  Unfortunately, it was a rainy and gray day, but I can certainly see the appeal of coming here during nicer weather.\\n\\nThe lookout consists of the covered bar area, but has ample seating outdoors too.  You can catch some water views in the distance. \\n\\nDrink prices seemed to be about average, I got a Shock Top that was on special and hubby went for some kind of frozen concoction. \\n\\nThe bartender was pleasant, but it took a little bit of time to get our check. \\n\\nNot a bad place to come for a drink!Been here multiple times and the only one worth a darn is sarah or Alicia and they take care of me and the service is great. But everyone else is terrible there and they struggle to do the simplest things. It's so hard to wait for 20 minutes for cold food and then have to get back to work after waiting half of a break for cold food. Awful would not be back againGot our drinks orders right away. Then waited 45+ minutes for our food to come. All we ordered was a salad, soup, and stone crabs. Unacceptable wait time for that sort of food, and wasn't even a busy night.\\n\\nAlso saw a party of 2 being sat down and not even being tended to for over 30 minutes. Last time I will ever go to HootersWe were sat very fast, service was great, they wouldn't let us sit down before the waitress swept our table. Food was hot and served fast.Food was good and the service was great. Indoor outdoor seating. Drinks were on spot. Kid friendly also. Within walking distance of all of the hotels on Clearwater Beach. Portions were very large.This is a great hooters  in clearwater. Nice location. And nice servers. Friendly. Found  a spot at the bar and got the spiciest  wings and chipotle garlic. Both good. Got the ipa  beer and lemonade  vodka which was 6 bucks. All good great crowd. Will come back.It has been a long time since ive been to a decent hooters. This particular location is just outstanding. My waitress, Ari, was amazing. She did a fantastic job waiting not only on me but other tables too. I think I just found my spot for Wednesday, thursdays, and saturdays. The food was great as well. The size of the dressings are huge compared to other locations up North. Would highly recommend coming here on the daily. If I could give it more stars I would but 5 will have to suffice.Karson should be lead server.......maybe others could learn how to be humble.....no one is above anyone no matter what your position! !!!!! 5 stars for service only....I went yesterday around 5 PM with my girl friend and 2 other friends to eat and drink before heading back to Orlando. After eating our food we wanted to order another round of shots which unfortunately the manager ( female - don't remember the name ) cut us off from the bar! When we asked her why were we cut off she gave us a response that we were being loud. I looked around the restaurant and everyone else was being loud. My thought was why were we being singled out ? My friend felt discriminated (Hispanic) and expressed his concern to the manager and her response was \\\" we are done here\\\" I also work in the hospitality industry (management) and there was no empathy or resolution from the manager and frankly we all left feeling discriminated because we were Hispanic and loud. I wouldn't come back here again. Thank you for your time2 stars because they don't have the full menu and besides the view the experience wasn't anything special! No quesadillas was really a bummer. The view on the top patio is amazing though esp if you can catch it at sunset. The seagulls seem to have figured out how to fly underneath the beams in roof though and was a little suspect. I've noticed other places putting fishing wire or some type of wire around their patios that keep  them away maybe this location should try it. \\nWe ordered the tator tots as an app and we ended up having to get a side of cheese because there was hardly any on them and hardly any other toppings really. We also ordered wings and while I'm not a fan of hooter ' s wings I ordered them naked this time and they were slightly better than usual.Order came out quick, wanted nachos spicy came out no spice. But where not bad\\nWife wanted mild chicken sandwich came out spicy. And wings came out sauced I ordered sauce on the side. Drinks took 15 mins to come to table. Place was not overly busy.It's a nice looking fun place of course! Great location. The consistency here is right in line with the chain. Prices are fine for what you're getting. It's a repeat place. It was all good except for a couple things like a blond hair wrapped around my celery, and cleanliness was a bit under par.\\nIt's enough to knock it down a star. \\n\\nTaste- 4 stars\\nService- 4 stars \\nCleanliness- 2 stars\\nVibe- 4 stars \\nValue- 4 StarsOrdered take out and there were multiple bugs inside all 3 to go silverware packs ... called to kindly let manager know and I was put on hold for 10 minutes till I gave up on waiting.., definitely pretty gross!!! I understand you're a busy establishment but seriously have the staff pay attention to detail.. if there Are bugs there they are going to be everywhere else!!We went to Hooters to have a couple drinks and some chicken wings. We have a Hooters in Minneapolis, so it wasn't a place we thought we were gonna go, but figured why not. It was the best food and service we had on Clearwater Beach. I had the Daytona wings and they were so amazing. We had a few good shots and some good girly drinks. This was also the best service we had in the Clearwater area. I would recommend this place to anyone going to that area.This is my favorite place to catch the sunset. The service is always great and I love the steamed crab legs and bucket of steamed oysters. Located on the roundabout, it's great for people watching. The top deck is fun on a nice day. The roof rolls back so you can get some sun. Live music keeps the beach party going. I still love the original Hooters but this is a great beach location.My wife and I ate here last night and the service and view were great, but the food was horrible. Not sure what happend as we've eaten here before, but it will definitely be our last time. We both became very ill today and had to miss work. I called the manager and inquired about food poisoning or other complaints- none they were aware of.  Judging by the other reviews, they really need some help here. I am calling corporate after this review- we hardly ever complain, but this was completely warranted. I don't need to pay good money to feel like sh*t all day!Leah R.  Your return comments are generic and not genuine.  Your better off just not responding at all.  Quite insulting, to say the least.Called ahead for the wait on a party of 7.  We were told there was no wait.  Walked 2 miles with a disabled person.  Climbed two flights of stairs to discover 50 people in line and a hostess who said she couldn't believe 'they' told us there was no wait.  Pffft.What a great roof top bar with live music and the best views in Clearwater. Love this place, great food !!!!!!Well most of us know hooters.  We have been here a couple times. Mostly for the wings.  I have also gone just for their steamed shrimp and crab legs. They are pretty good.  Clearwater Beach Hooters has a great location to take pics by the water. We are lucky to have the new Clearwater Beach Hooters location, and get to witness the great beauty of the beach.  \\nThere are several levels at this hooters. Definitely different than what I have seen before.  We have also been to the hooters in Clearwater. It is pretty cool that it is the first Hooters.They close at midnight. They don't post their hours anywhere. Tell you when you walk in the door. Not convenient at all, for vacationer or usual beachside residentAs a former hooters girls (my friend and I) were extremely excited to come to this location only to enter the establishment and be greeted rudely by the host announcing that the restaurant was closed. It was 10pm on a Saturday night! Then I look on here and it's supposed to close at 11. Highly disappointingOk I know it's a hooters so not looking for a 5 star experience here but at least crush the service and food portions of the test. This is a great spot with outstanding views of the water from the second floor balcony. Really windy the day I was here and they serve drinks in plastic cups so things were flying. Got their hottest wings and they were dry and the sauce was a medium heat at best - thought wings were what this place was known for. \\n\\nService was really bad. The girls spent more time chatting with each other. Brought food with no silverware and we waited 5 mins until she came back. Good place to stop for a beer but rest was pretty badEnjoyed.... Good service .. Drinks great.,reasonable priced.... Sat outside great views of Clearwater Beach.I love the view at this location of all the action and the beach. My concern here is the same as my concern at another location which is the visible dirty garbage can and bin full of dishes literally right next to your table. It should be hidden away. It makes me sick to see that while I'm eating. Nothing could turn me off more. I really hope they fix this because I do like to go there otherwise.The food was great. Our waitress was horrible. We were in around 4 on a Monday. She was more interested in playing songs on the juke box with the bus boy then waiting on us. I have had a lot of friends back in Philly who work at Hooters and and it's always a good time. Plus no happy hour? Every other Hooters has one. You guys need to step your game up!We have eaten at several Hooters over the years. This one has a great atmosphere- you are at the beach! The service was fast and friendly. The food was ok. We had the cheese sticks and buffalo shrimp for an appetizer. Both were excellent. Both my husband and son ordered burgers. Burgers were big but had too much seasoning so it gave them heart burn. I had medium wings and two of them still had a feather; big turn off. The other wings were excellent. Curly fries tasted like the were reheated. Overall, a good experience and just a couple of opportunities to improve the food.Beware the menu is different from location to location. They screwed up our alcoholic drinks (they must have forgotten the alcohol altogether). We got buffalo sauce on the side and it was very watery and brownish in color. The waitress said it was because they mix it with variable amounts of butter. Kind of disappointing for a hooters. Our waitress was awesome though and made up for each of those complaints.Ok people, I was a little nervous to come here after the terrible yelp reviews...but this place was great!! Our server, Alana, was sooo nice and fun. She even gave us extra free sauce and recommendations for local activities. \\n\\nWe got the naked wing and curly fries - wings were BOMB but fries were a bit pale/not as crispy as I like (I am a crispy fry gal). Overall, ignore the yelp reviews and go - what are ya waiting for?!This is probably the worst Hooters. Whether you eat there or get the food delivered by UberEATS the food is terrible. It is unfortunate that this restaurant doesn't seem to care about the quality of its food. Hopefully, the corporate office cleans house of this restaurant's current management, including kitchen manager and GM, and then tries to start serving decent food.It is a shame this one got a nice location and great view but worse and worse service. I have been here quite a few times. The food portion shrink badly. $50's food would make you feel you didn't eat anything, and when I try to order some more food, the waitress just can't wait to drop the check to me. If you want to have a good vacation at Clear Water, don't go to this Hooters.Hooters, wtf?\\n\\nI've been to several hooters locations in central Florida, always receiving good service & food. This is the first time I've been completely dissapointed. To start, our waitress was extremely rude and just seemed super annoyed that we were even there. We ordered oysters, an order of 10 mild(breaded wings), and curly fries. The oysters were ok, the real problem was when I accidentally knocked the cup of butter to the ground. I waved over our waitress who rolled her eyes and said she'd go get more. She never returned with any butter, but finally came back 25 min later with the wings and fries. The wings just didnt taste fresh and tasted \\\"off\\\". The fries were soggy and really inedible. Im not sure what went wrong during this visit, but please try to fix your issues. Not sure if or when ill be returning.Usually love coming to see the girls. Don't really got but my wife was game. Went for a friends birthday. He got nothing special. Our wings we're suppose to be hot. They had no flavor. Our party of 4 got different wings sauces. They all tasted the same. They had no flavor. We barely saw our waitress. We talked more with another waitress since it was her birthday. Won't be coming back to this hootersNo stars if possible .Horrible service from the minute we walked in! Last thing to expect while in vacation , defiantly not \\\"tourist friendly \\\" restaurant at all . Gave us a hard time about not having \\\"proper attire\\\" after attempting to put a shirt on. Another waiter began screaming \\\"and!! I'm telling you you need a shirt on!\\\" Manager just came out and I guess escorted us to the exit. Staff is horrible and the management team was next to poor. It was embarrassing for them as a whole establishment. I was also with my 5 year old child who witnessed us being attached by staffs members of a restaurant. Just down right rude.Came here a few days ago with my boyfriend and I completely regret stepping foot in this place. We went up to the second floor because the first floor was packed. The view up there was really beautiful, as it overlooked the beach. The only issue was that everything kept on blowing off the table because of the wind, but the scenery made up for it.\\n\\nNow lets get to the reason why I would never come back to this place-- The service. Our server's name was Summer. When she was taking our orders, I specifically asked for the Mediterranean Mahi Salad, while my boyfriend ordered a burger. A long moment after, our food finally came out. I looked at my salad and at first glance there were absolutely no signs of mahi in it. So I thought to myself 'the mahi must be buried somewhere deep beneath the salad'. After vigorously poking through my salad dish, I realized that there really was no mahi in it. I mean the whole point of me ordering a salad called Mediterranean MAHI Salad was for the fish...otherwise I would have just paid less money for a plain salad. Anyways, why did it take so long for our food to come out when they didn't even remember to put the fish in my salad? \\n\\nAfterwards, I politely called our server over and told her that there wasn't any mahi in the salad. Instead of being sincerely apologetic due to HER mistake, she got all defensive and basically said that it was MY fault for not letting her know that I had wanted the fish in my salad. She said that since I didn't clearly tell her that I had wanted mahi in my salad that she \\\"assumed that I had wanted the regular Mediterranean Salad\\\". And then, she quickly threw in a sorry and left to ring in the order of mahi.\\n\\nOkay. Let me get this straight. As the customer, I have to tell the server that I want fish in my salad when the salad has the name of the fish in it? And when the description under the salad states that the fish is included??? Otherwise, she's just going to \\\"assume\\\" that I don't want the fish? By the way, I looked at the menu again and there was no such salad on there as a \\\"regular\\\" Mediterranean Salad. The girl literally just pulled that out of her butt as an excuse to cover up for her mistake and put the blame on me. As a server, myself, I was completely  mindblown that someone could provide such awful service. All she had to do was apologize for her mistake, but instead, she decided to make it seem as if it was my fault. Did she think I was born yesterday? If one of my customers at work ever ordered, say a Salmon Salad, I'm not going to make the assumption that they don't want the Salmon....when they ordered a salad with the name 'Salmon' in it. That makes absolutely no sense!! \\n\\nSo, after waiting for another 15 minutes or so, the server brought out my mahi. And the worst part is that a few hours later, I was throwing up on the beach due to food poisoning. I hadn't eaten anything else all day, so I knew immediately that I had gotten sick from that salad. My boyfriend and I had to leave the beautiful beach early and I was vomiting and bedridden at our hotel for the rest of the day. \\n\\nWith all that being said, save your money and go somewhere else to eat down the street. There are several other restaurants along Mandalay Ave that will provide you with way better service and food that will actually stay in your stomach and not ruin your vacation day at the gorgeous beach.Service was average. Mostly we were annoyed about the lack of a full menu and skimpy sauce selection. Drive the 20 minutes into Clearwater for a full Hooters experience and skip this one.This hooters location is awesome because of it's amazing view of the surroundings. I was served by a waitress named Charity who was very helpful with the menu and was very pleasant. The managers were on sight and greeted us (party of 6) and made us feel welcomed. Great location, great service but the food I ordered was not good. I ordered the Mediterranean mahi salad and the fish was pretty good, although it was a very small portioned, but the salad was very bad quality. It was soaked in dressing and the leaves were soft and in small bits. I saw nothing else in that salad beside the leaves, some black olives and very few orange bits. No doubt I got the bottom of that salad, and I know better than to send it back to the kitchen. The other people I was with enjoyed the wings and fries. The Mediterranean mahi salad is not worth the price even if the salad is good. Take it off the menu or revamp the salad. Other than that \\nA-ok.Girls got bad attitudes and their food didn't make up for it. Nachos and wings are okay but not the best.We came here to watch some playoff football. I called to inquire about drink specials, and was told they had 100oz beers for $11.99. I thought that sounded fun. However, when we ordered, our waitress informed us that there were no specials. Kinda disappointing. We got 3 mile hot wings and some chipotle garlic ones. The 3 mile wings were great, but I didn't care for the chipotle garlic. Pretty girls in silly outfits just didn't overcome the negatives.Not impressed at all! We have been here twice and it got worse! By far the worst Hooters establishment we have been in! Waitstaff drama, skunk draft beer (Bud Light), waitstaff not very happy to be part of the GREAT Hooter traditon! 0 stars!! I had to put a 1 up to submit!!Service was really good this day.  Had a good seat on the 2nd floor outside looking right out over the gulf.  The only food we got were the original wings.  They were prepared perfectly and tasted awesome.  We got the hot which was not hot enough for me so I added more.  Over all a pretty good experience here.So a girl customer at hooters has to cover her stomach and sleeves because it's company policy but a guy doesn't have to cover up. All so guys can watch the girls that work there. #hooters #thisisamerica\\n\\nThe customer service was atrocious \\n\\nCommon customer question. \\n\\\"What drinks do you have \\\" \\n\\nANSWER from Hooters employee\\n\\\"Well look at the menu\\\"\\n\\nI am in shock \\n\\nI don't expect red carpet service but get it together \\nPlus it's a beach . How welcoming to people who just came from beachI can' see how this place be came so popular. So-so food and service . We can make better wings at home. Their hot is just about a medium or mild any place else . The burger was dry and tasteless. The beer selection isn't anything to get excited about. You would be better going to any of the bars in the area.Seriously?! Disappointed! Mini wings, weak drinks and slow service. I feel bad for the live music because he's good, and it's empty on a Friday night during spring break. Boo!!! Hooters, boo!!! Sorry to our server, she was sweet, but it's a no.We recently ate at this location and enjoyed the food and service but very disappointed with the restaurant itself, it was dirty and unappealing. It is shocking that Hooters mgmt does not give more attention to this restaurant located in such a prime area. It really feels like a dive, it needs a serious facelift.  It's not a simple general cleaning that's needed but a complete renovation.  Please spend the money...quick!!!HORRIBLE in every way possible. First arrived & asked if we parked in the correct spot to not get towed. The 3 employees standing at doorway/podium stated no and that we needed to move our car. When asked where we should park, none of them had a coordinated or practical answer. Service was slow all around - food, service at table, gift shop. Tables weren't cleaned until they brought guests them to it, THEN wiped it down. I ordered the wings and & tater tots with cheese. The tots were good, nothing special. The cheese sauce was lukewarm & my wings (medium, breaded, bone-in) were disgustingly inedible. There was so much breading & such little meat, I felt like I was eating bread & butter. There was no flavor to them & they came on a plate sitting in a pool of grease (see picture added). I informed waitress that I did not like the wings & didn't want to eat them & jus replied \\\"oh, ok.\\\" At a later time she apologized for them & took the charge off the bill. Overall, just an awful experience. I'll never go back to hooters.My son, boyfriend and myself went here for New Year's Eve before watching the firework and brining in the new year. When we got there it wasn't all that busy, it was around 9 p.m. The service wasn't anything to brag about. Our waitress seemed like she was somewhere else. She asked what we wanted to drink, I said I did not know bring me something sweet with liquor. My botfriend also ordered a shot and beer. His come out and about 5 mins later I still did not have my drink, so I assumed she didn't hear me. So I ordered my own pick of drink, that took about 10 mins to come out. Then we get the bill and she charged me for the first drink that I never got. This is my second Hooters location in the last 6 months and niether one were anything worth go back for. It's not horrible service, it's just not good service either.Waitress was super friendly but only when we could find her. The food took way too long to come and we ordered 1 thing (!) right when we ordered drinks to make things go quicker, but It didn't help. It also wasn't busy enough to say she was busy with other tables so unfortunately I won't be back anytime soon.I love Hooters. I am a Hooters girl. Well, not really a Hooters girl, as in a girl that works at Hooters. But I am a HUGE fan of their wings, fries, and blue cheese dressing. And it's all perfectly topped off with an ice cold pitcher of beer. Hubby and I finally decided to stray from the original Hooters last Friday since it was absolutely gorgeous out and we wanted to be near the beach. It was the perfect day to go to the beach location and try it out. \\n\\nWe sat on the patio (2nd floor) and had the perfect view of the pier and the round-about. The only thing that would have been more perfect was if we could see the actual water from our seats. The breeze was wonderful.\\n\\nWe ordered our usual (see above!) and it was delicious. The server was great, she was attentive without being too attentive, and knew exactly when to stop by. I have no complaints about the food or service. \\n\\nMy ONLY complaint is... They only have key lime pie at this location. Hubby and I will order dessert on occasion - he loves the peanut butter pie and I love the evil chocolate cake. I was really surprised when she told me they were not like the Original Hooters and only have key lime pie. So, we passed on dessert.\\n\\nThis is really minor, and the only reason I did 4 stars instead of 5. Will the lack of dessert choices stop me from going back? No. The view and yummy food more than makes up for it.This is NOTHING like the Hooter where I live in Fort Lauderdale (which is amazing). The menu is limited and they charge for everything down to the sauce for your wings (not extra sauce...just the sauce that \\\"come with it\\\"). DesperateI had the worst experience in this restaurant because the were marking some fake stories to excuse themselves from having bad service. Also, we had to wait around 2 hours just to get some burgers, and I have some visitors from out of country who expects a lot from this restaurant. I recommend to not go there because their food was not good and the bread was not fresh.Tried Hooters from the ad for famous wings. Was not impressed with wings. They were ok but certainly not anything special.\\n\\nAlso ordered a hamburger and fries. Meat was rare even though I asked for well done and patty was dry and tasteless.\\n\\nThe bar drinks were ok I but that is not enough to have me back.Some friends and I stopped in for a snack and some beers while killing time b/t a wedding ceremony and reception. I am not normally a Hooter's fan but this visit has changed my mind for the better.\\nRecommendation: Clearwater is home to the original/first Hooters restaurant! While I did not realize that until I was on my way to the airport it might be worth checking out as well.\\n\\nDecor: It's a Hooters... a sports bar that is \\\"delightfully tacky yet unrefined,\\\" as they say. And I'd agree. There are, of course, plenty of TVs for you to catch a game and there are some solid patios (and a rooftop? not sure...) were you can enjoy a nice day while you eat and drink.\\nBathroom: I didn't use the bathroom during my visit.\\n\\nStaff: All the girls were very friendly and nice, some were pretty cute too. We did have a small, and comical, experience with our waitress that involved my friend asking for a bucket of Miller Lites: she told him that they were not on special; he said that it was fine, just charge him for 5 MLs and bring them in a bucket... she completely did not understand and, after a painful back and forth, he finally gave up. She left and we sat wondering what is difficult about putting 5 beers in a bucket of ice (they have the buckets, as a bucket of Coronas was on special!). Anyway, it really wasn't a big deal and she was wonderful beyond that.\\n\\nFood/Drinks: Aside from the ML incident, the drinks were great and cold. The food, which is something that has kept me away from Hooters for a while now, was surprisingly wonderful! In the past I've only ordered the wings, with sauce, and, b/c the sauce is \\\"butter based\\\" not been happy with the outcome (wings, swimming in sauce/grease). This time, however, I ordered one of their dry rubs, the Jerk, and it was awesome! I dipped the tenders in some ranch and was very pleased. My friends also ordered a burger (standard), potato wedges (standard), and traditional wings (good).\\n\\nValue: Again, it's a Hooters. Not outrageous, not cheap, right where you'd expect for a meal at a sports bar.\\n\\nAfter this visit I will certainly be reconsidering my boycott of Hooters in the future.I only come here for their wings.. Honest! Nice location, and good view from the open air balcony on second floor.  Good mix of people in here, not just all guys ogling the waitresses. If you're not just drinking beer, be careful as their mix drinks can be pretty strong, I nearly killed myself skating home last time I was here. If your getting pick up they have a single parking spot at the rear of the store. Otherwise you're probably at the beach and had to pay Clearwater beaches new hefty parking fees.Love this place!!! Alex and Olivia had such great spirits and team work ethic. Glad to see girls having so much fun while giving excellent service.This place is a joke.  Don't order naked wings they amount to mini sized wings and watered down blue cheese.  Just shows how much bread if you get on the originals.  Service was slow, really slow.  Avoid and save your money.I read all of the recent reviews and was a little apprehensive about going but SO GLAD that we did!!  Our waitress Alicia was so cute and attentive; LOVED her!!  The drinks, the wings, and everything else was bomb! Definitely will be returning soon!Great experience today. We were at two local establishments that we walked out of 15 minutes prior because their customer service was a disgrace. Hooters was a pleasant time and I was happy to give then my money. Gabrielle at the bar upstairs was attentive and nice.Service was good. \\n\\nClean and well organized. \\n\\nHad the best chicken ceaser salad and wings! \\n\\nDaytona wings and get the buffalo shrimps but instead get it with the honey tai sauce. Delicious!!!!!!!!!! \\n\\n\\nFYI: sit outside to catch the most beautiful sunset.My fiance's family and I went here for a late lunch this afternoon and not impressed. We ordered 20 boneless wings, they shouldn't call them wings more like boneless marbles by the size that they came out. We tried to order grouper and fish and chips and they were out. How can you be out of fish in Florida? Pretty much everyone was disappointed in the food choices they made. Won't go back to a hooters in the future. Terrible franchise.I came here after a night out on the beach and I ordered curly fries and boneless wings. My waitress was very nice and efficient. The wings were delicious,  as were the fries. There weren't a lot of people so it wasn't overcrowded. I enjoyed the atmosphere and how nice it was to be on the second floor overlooking Clearwater beach. \\n\\nI recommend this place & will return. :)Service is awful. Been here twice and both times I get out in a corner and forgotten about for 20 minutesHere working for a week. It isn't a exspence report unless Hooters receipt is on the report. Not something to be proud of maybe but I have been to most of the Hooters. \\nthe service was very good a real nice location. I ordered wings and tater tots. \\n\\nThey came out very fast. Unfortunately both were still cold. I sent both back with no hassle paid for my beer then left. poor showing from Hooters in their original hometown.\\nWill still go to Hooters but not that one.Beautiful rooftop view with live music...a great place to watch the sunset!If you want a burger & fries, this may be ok. But for wings and buffalo shrimp (my personal favorites), avoid this location at all costs. The shrimp must have been cooked first then sat until what should be a crispy coating became what can only be described as mush. Then the Daytona Wings while prepared well (several minutes after the shrimp were done) looked as though they came from pigeons rather than chickens. Both served at the same time by a staff that clearly acted as if they had no stake in the game. Finally, if you just can't handle the cravings for Hooters in this prime location, make sure you go there before 11pm on the weekends and 10pm Sunday. That said, there is a place open just a few doors down that will gladly serve you $.50 wings after 9pm that are twice the size.Service was fair, we sat down immediately for a party of nine, waited 15 minutes before our drink order was taken. Naked mild wings were delicious. Waitresses sang happy birthday to my baby. All the Lovely girls were very nice.Quick service, good view of town, standard quality of American food. The price was right. Not quite a place for a family dinner but it met our needs for food.Our waitress had about as much personality as my shoe. We had wings which were good and large. I ordered the Buffalo nachos which had gross fake cheese and about 1 ounce of chicken. I would never go back.Had to look at the cooks neck while he was on the phone grabbing on the bartenders the whole time I was eating. Last time I eat here. 100 percent not recommended. Bad food bad experience for somewhere on Clearwater beach.This is a very nice second floor location. We were nicely greeted, promptly seated, and our drink order taken. Our drinks came within a reasonable amount of time. We ordered 30 wings and when received they were tasty but on the smaller side.\\n\\nI have been coming to Hooters for years and I have noticed two things. Anyone can be a hooters girl now. I think they used to be much more selective in the past. The wings, though tasty, are shrinking in size..Do not sit at the bar. The bartender at the time is rude and doesn't acknowledge customers' orders. Waited 10 minutes with no service.Most hooters restaurants are fun and lively. Here, the servers are unfriendly and unhappy. Our server forgot to put in our order and then blamed the kitchen staff. The Manager told us our food was \\\"comped\\\" because we had waited so long. When the check came it was only 25% off. Comped to a reasonable person means free. We had terrible service, waited forever, were lied to and frankly ripped off. Not sure I will ever go to this branch again.Terrible experience.  I have been to several other Hooters and wanted to share the experience with my son for his first Hooters experience. The service was lame and our waitresses were ordinary. For some reason we had three ladies serve the table. We ordered a 20 (medium heat) wing platter and onion rings. The onion rings were the frozen variety by your local Costco. The wings had no heat in taste and temperature. We were shorted 2 wings. I asked and received 2 other wings which were dropped on our platter with a scowl. Those wings by the way, were cold. Our blue cheese was extra. How cheap. Every other restaurant includes blue cheese or ranch for free.  We also did not get the celery. Oh, did I say cheap!!!!\\n\\nI am a local with no intentions of returning or recommending Hooters.Here I am at Hooters and I got my fight on w/ no fuss or dirty looks.  And the service is fast and friendly.   I wish I could get this kind of service from smaller chain restaurants in the area.  Oh well,  big corporate wins again,  shut up and take my money.  Great job.Among the wing joints around here, I give Hooters kudos for being the classiest in the area. Servers r fun & professional (& beautiful) ;-) Prices reasonable, only suggestion I have from a regular is maybe to expand the menu a little bit. Already good variety but more selection and/or flexibility.Wanted to sit and enjoy the beach view while having a drink. But they didn't have Budweiser in glass bottle.  Disappointing!The very first Hooters ever is right here in Clearwater, FL. Very good atmosphere with fast service. Great selection, I had a cheeseburger which was delicious!This was a very mundane experience.  Its Hooters and I've been to dozens of them across the country.  I thought this one would be better than average because of the location.  It was not.  Neither the food nor our server was hot.  In fact the only thing bright about our server was her orange shorts. I asked for regular boneless which she interpreted as naked. I ate them anyway.  She failed to acknowledge that they used Pepsi products when I order a Diet Coke (I'm not a fan of Pepsi) and acted surprised when I explained I wanted something else.  There were 4 plates on our table and she took away the only one I was still eating off of. She was simply clueless. Never utter a single, helpful or kind word.  Just looked like she was going through the motions. Wrong food, wrong drink wrong attitude for the service industry.  Sorry Hooters but it's no go.Dirty, bad food, mediocre service. We were sat on the patio, someone spilled coke on the chairs and my husband sat in it. While my husband went to the bathroom to cleanup, I told the manager who was holding up the wall with his back. He sat us at an inside table and had to get a stick to wipe down the AC so it didn't drip on us (which it did). Also, he never sent anyone to clean the table with the spill. We ordered key lime pie. The server came out to take our spoons before we used them because they still had dish soap on them, there was a kitchen manager in the kitchen at the time. No matter where we travel every Hooters seems to have similar standards.Every time to come to Clearwater I have to come here ! This time our service was just as excellent as it always is. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because our server (Simone) seemed a little distracted. Every time we needed her she was playing around with other coworkers. But despite that her service was ok! None the less I will be back !Slow. Usually you can count on Hooters for good food and service. Service is a step off on this night, from the table side to the kitchen.You can count on Hooters for good food and good service and this location was no different. Sat upstairs and enjoyed the evening breeze. The beer selection was better than most locations and they kept our glasses full. \\nMy order was simple 10 wings half Daytona and the other half Thai, all 10 were delicious.\\nA couple of beers and 10 wings $18.00We ordered the buffalo shrimp hot. They arrived quickly. Our bartender Alexandra was attentive and always asked if we needed anything more. This location on the 2nd floor overlooks Clearwater Beach and the roundabout. The traffic from the roundabout can be noisy, but it the perfect place to people watch. This is one of the smallest locations I've ever been to. I rate the service a 5. The food a 4. The beer is served in plastic cups. They do have several local brews on tap and bottled which rates them a 5 for beer variety despite the plastic cups. I rate them a 3 for watching sports. I'm not a Rays fan, but if the local team is playing at least turn the sound up and turn off the crappy music. Many of the TV's are on the small size and not well placed . I still like coming here because of the location.Staff and drinks excellent. \\nNote to owner: the floor by bar is like the Pittsburgh Penguins ice hockey surface. \\nMy 4 star rating is bc of the slippery floor.The Hooters restaurant in Clearwater Beach was not good at all. Money wasted. The service was not the best. Server was over work. Had to many people to service. She was running between table. The food was not prepared correctly and under cook. Curly fries were cold and hard(old), return it to get one that was under cooked. The chicken wings were also under cooked and very oily with the breaded area hard and falling apart. The chicken wings sauce was oil and it separate from the ingredients One of the drinks we order was a pi\\u00f1a colada. It was so bad and like slushie we had to return it. All of the rest of food was ok. Not worth the $95.00.Service sucked! We sat down on the bar, they acknowledged us at first, but took forever to take our order. Naked chicken was good, had two side salads with blue cheese dressing, I should of taken a pic, the blue cheese was really bad with fungus living in it, smelled horrible!!! Told one of the girls and she just smiled and said okay and took it and not even ask if we needed new dressing or even say sorry!!! And all the girls that worked there was more interested in the football game and not taking care of there customers. We had to flag down a waitress for dressing. Then the girl at the bar came back to us and said I was getting you more dressing just closing out a tab, umm okay and she brought back more blue cheese dressing that was watery!! Didn't eat the salad. Horrible wouldn't recommend, if there dressing is bad the kitchen must be disgusting!! Had our one drink and left.Well since Hooters is Originally from Florida I decided to try this one 2 days ago since my friend lives by and I have not been in Tampa/Clearwater beach for some time since 1984. Anyways I have been to the Hooters in Schaumburg, and in Chicago by Higgins Rd as well as around Joilet, IL and I am disappointed by the portions of the boneless chicken. If people come for just the Women in tight shorts and alluring bosoms and NOT the quality of food, than I would go to those triple X places. Anyways I give this particular Hooters 4 stars because the portions size for 10 Boneless Chicken wings was bigger and satisfying. Also the Hooters women were much more smarter and friendlier. Just wanted to say that. I would come back here to this particular Hooters for that and even will try their Grouper Sandwich that other Hooter's Do NOT Offer. Keep up the great work, Ladies! Especially Maddie and Kristin.It has a nice beach view and feel.  The women were very friendly and attentive.  I remember the food being much better when the place was a smaller chain.  I still think to watch a game and have some beers this may be the best spot in Clearwater.  They have a ton of TVs and a great patio area.Cool place for the location. Great views. Food not so good. And a few drink specials they had weren't available bc they didn't have all the ingredients to make them. Service not so good either. Very slow.Yeah, you really could just pass this one by. Pluses are the wings are good as usual, and a good place to watch sports. They really need to work on the wait staff. If we would have been waited on better they would have sold a few more drinks to go with our dinner. We ate, we left.We came here on Wednesday night to have a drink. Place was busy so we sat at the bar. Bartender was very friendly and attentive. We got couple of local beers and naked wings. Beer was good but wings not so much that's why 4 stars.We came in yesterday afternoon, a large group of us. 13+ we ordered wings and nachos for the table to start. Wings were the worst and the nachos too, wings were too greasy and fatty to eat and the nachos, well, tiny and cheap. We ate this \\\"food\\\" because all of us were extremely hungry.., I had a 14.00 fish sandwich that was mediocre and someone else had boneless wings that they didn't eat, took to go because she didn't want to embarrass anyone. Service was poor, girl was nice but inattentive. We had piles of dirty plates and napkins and empty cups until alas we had to call over a manager who seemed surprised but not very interested! One lady paid the entire check (can't imagine the cost) it was auto grated, she even left I bit extra out of guilt and obligation and all of us left beyond disappointed.. very sad, this is Not the Hooters i expected!! WSRSCame here on my birthday and sat at the bar. Our bartender was distracted by whatever was happening on her phone and her service was lacking. My girlfriend and I ended up leaving to find another bar to enjoy because that was not the spot that night. Our appetizers were delicious though and I hope whatever was bothering our bartender is resolved.Location is good but food was very mediocre. I typically enjoy the steamed shrimp at the Hooter's back home but they were very dry (overcooked) and my hubby was not thrilled with the burger (his go to) either. We went last minute because we could sit outside with a roof (storming) and no wait.Standard Hooters. Stayed in Clearwater Beach and wanted a place to chill with like- minded sports fans and knew Hooters would have the right company and TVs. Sat at the bar and was greeted promptly by a friendly bartender. Service time was fair for a slow night - only got fried pickles so expected faster service but no complaints, they were really good. Did not feel weird about being at this Hooters as the girls were acting like professional waitresses vs...what you might expect at an establishment such as this. Ladies, bring your boyfriends, husbands, children, whatever. Great place all around. You want sports and a \\\"hanging with the guys\\\" atmosphere, here it is. Plus, it has an outdoor bar space that is open to the outside! You can't beat this. Enjoy!Good location. Server was great. Chicken was not cooked with boneless wings. Set down to watch the Super Bowl and two TVs were not working. Won't be back.Was so excited to try these wings since I've never had them before and have always heard great things. I ordered medium wings expecting a sauce to be on them obviously. When they arrived they were completely dry..I thought well maybe I accidentally ordered a dry rub or something? We called and told them there was no sauce and the lady said \\\"the sauce is clear, it like soaks into them we get that a lot\\\" since I've never eaten there and had no idea what to expect I just laughed it off and tried them. I looked at pictures others have posted of them too and I can see what she meant by it being more on the clear side..but there was absolutely no liquid around my wings at all, not a single drop. Four of us tried them to make sure I wasn't crazy. There was no sauce that had \\\"soaked in\\\"...no flavor, no seasoning..nothing at alllll. It was just fried chicken. Very disappointed they didn't offer to fix them or anythingI normally go to the Original Hooters when I'm in Clearwater but we were staying right across the street from this location so we decided to go in for a quick dinner. I asked the girls at the hostess stand if we could have a table by the windows so we could see the sunset by the beach and after an exaggerated eye roll I was told \\\"Third floor is open seating\\\".\\nWe went upstairs and picked a nice spot and our waitress came by quickly. We ordered fried pickles as an appetizer and 40 boneless wings double dipped. We never got our pickles and our wings were over cooked and super hard.\\nEven though the food was bad and the hostess rude, our waitress was very nice and made our meal a little better.I'm generally not a huge fan of Hooters, but my friend and I thought we would give it a chance and were both blown away. The food was excellent. Our server Carmela was on it and had our food out to us in no time. She is a very good employee. Even had a cool view !The service here was terrible! When I explained to the waitress my dietary restrictions, she made an extremely offensive comment. She took forever to bring out ranch and blue cheese, and we were practically done with our meals before we got it. She was also extremely rude.Love this place...I bit more expensive than other wing places, but love the view of the beach and circle.  Wish all hooters included one ranch or blue cheese.  Food is good, staff is friendly and place is clean and \\\"with a new h view.\\\"  Don't get caught up on that it's a chain, or you will miss out on a enjoyable meal.I'm a fan of hooters and I enjoyed this location.  My gf and I went after a miserable experience at cooters.  The food and service was perfect.  I would recommend this location over the original any day of the week.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I was charged .89 for two samples of sauce before ordering. I'm petty like that.Besides its location, i have had beyter experiences at other hooters locations.  The employees there seem miserable and are not that attentive.  Maybe it was just a bad day \\u200dVery disappointed. I'm a local bit a tourist who comes to the beach3-4 times a week and my girl's and me love Hooters not not this location anymore. For $73 I expect better wings and service. The food was disgusting, sorry, the service less then desirable. It seems like all the employees we just interested in turning tables as fast as they could, so basically it was all about making a profit and no customer service and the less them desirable food and that was the biggest disappointment.Service was good but the food: terrible. The restaurant was hot inside. The beer wasn't crisp cold. Wings were okay, lacked sauce. The blue cheese was watery, almost like they mixed 3/4 ranch with 1/4 blue cheese. Fries mushy. The only good thing was the jalape\\u00f1o cheese and the celery. Don't go.My family and I had the most amazing experience here. This was my first time at Hooters and thoroughly enjoyed it. Our waitress Brooke was more than amazing. She was very on top of everything and treated us like we were her first priority. Would recommend this restaurant and location!!I would give this place 2.5 stars if I could. The food was great and came out in a decent amount of time. The overall service on the other hand was awful. When we first came in, the hostess just seemed like she didn't want to be there. She just started walking off and we were confused if she was leading us to our table or what, it wasn't clear. The waitress came to our table 3 times the entire night and didn't refill our drinks. She also seemed like she just didn't want to be there. I understand it was near closing when we went but the poor service just made it into an unenjoyable dining experience.Service was prompt but I'm sure it was because it was slow. Beer was good but food was sub par. Hooters as a whole is falling off the map. Maybe one day they will regain traction. As for now fast food is way better.The blond server Julia was AMAZING, the manager was kind of rude but Julia really made our experience great and food was pretty good.Came in sat down at bar. Served our drinks, bartender never returned. After about 10 minutes a young girl that apparently was being trained stood behind bar and never did anything. When the bartender finally came back I asked her why the girl standing there couldn't help us and she claimed she was just a trainee. I suppose you could train trainees to take notice when people at the bar or not being waited on.  Just a thought.  When I finally paid for my beer got up and left, a young man sitting at the corner set a couple left right before us saying they couldn't get waited on either.  Funny thing is they want a dozen people in the place. Won't be back.  I try to stay away from franchises because of this very thing. People don't care when they don't have skin in the game.Our visit was horrible! They were not busy what so ever.. 6 empty seats at their 12 top bar. The two girls behind the bar were more interested in taking care of the guys then the couples sitting at the bar. We got our food pretty fast thanks to the kitchen but we were never asked how our food was or drinks nor did they tell us that our meal didn't include a side but proceeded to ask us what side we wanted with it. I asked for a water and waited 10 minutes to never receive it, ended up having to ask some one that wasn't even serving us.. unacceptable! I am a manager at another restaurant and would be very upset knowing this is how my employees treat our guest. The manager I spoke with was very understanding and helped us. I really hope these girls understand that everyone at their bar rail matters... not just the dudes.So I love my little hooters in Augusta Georgia imagine my surprise when i order my staple go to buffalo shrimp and it is untossed sitting in the sauce not to mention it is dry with a taste i can only describe as dry sawdust. I also had a strawberry lemonade that was so oversweetened it had to be mixed with water and i did order a side of fries which was exactly how it shouldve been. Our server Allyssa was very attentive and nice on the upside however the whole experience was slightly disappointing for me.The manager, Steve was very accommodating as the special listed on Retail Me Not was not applicable to this location. He took time out of his schedule to sit with us & made a fair adjustment to the bill. It's great service like this that will bring us back & recommend them. Our server Lanna was very polite.Great price on snow crab, and Grooper sandwich. Great taste and service too. Stop in for lunch.Visited the Clearwater Beach location this past December and I must say I was sadly disappointed.  First, what was good.  The 1lb of snow crab legs is definitely a good deal at around $17.95 I think.  The meat was sweet and came right out of the shell with ease.  Although no sides came with it, the price is right, and it comes with \\\"real\\\" drawn butter.  I stress that because some local competitors actually serve it with palm oil \\\"butter,\\\" i.e movie theater popcorn butter.  Yikes!  On to our salad, which was just meehh.  The honey-mustard dressing seemed watered down and lacking in richness or flavor.  Lastly, the wings.  I ordered 8 wings, traditional \\\"hot\\\" buffalo style.  The wings were on the soggy side with a little bit of crispiness, and the buffalo sauce was separated with puddles of oil beneath the wings.  The sauce was also greasy tasting and bland.  Very disappointing.  What was the most disappointing, however, was the fact that I only \\\"barely\\\" ate two of them, and when the waitress asked why and I explained, she never had the item removed from the bill.  Not cool and her tip would have been dramatically higher had she done the right thing and gone to the manager to have the item removed from the bill like most any experienced server would have done.  So there you have it.  With so many restaurants serving delicious, crispy, saucy, buffalo wings, I'm not sure if a return visit to Hooters will happen.the water they served was dirty, I don't know what happened but it was watered down, likewise the manager let us pay for it even though we didn't drink the beer, We ordered the hamburgers  medium and arrived well done, honestly all the food is horrible, I would never go to that restaurant again.  The only good thing was the service,  very kind waitress. Although the manager was very rude, I don't know why they have a manager like thatMy friend, his wife, and two kids were in town from California so we were checking out Clearwater Beach. They wanted food so he suggested we eat here and all though it was only my second time eating at this company it was nice. I don't know about bring the kids, but it's a great place to get a bite to eat while enjoying the view on the second story establishment.Great location but not good food . This is the worst wings that I had so for. The fish and ships were strait from the frozen box. Save your money and go somewhere  else.Hooters is your typical staple for chicken wings and this location is spot on. Service is decent and they have a rooftop bar. The location is a bit sketchy and the clientele is a bit on the white trash side. The venue is great for people watching and enjoying a beverage with friends. They have a small bar with indoor and outdoor seating.Okay, so I went in with low expectations but I'd never eaten at a Hooters before. I don't eat at many commercial chain restaurants and I expect the food to be uninspired. We are on vacation and my husband really wanted some chicken wings, so alas, we went to hooters. I don't need to make any commentary about the kitsch of Hooters... it's exactly what you think it is. Quite honestly our food wasn't bad - he got original wings (honey BBQ and Daytona BBQ), I got boneless wings (medium and Daytona BBQ), we both got a side salad and split some curly fries. The wings were pretty good, except the boneless wings weren't as saucy as the original wings. I asked for a side of sauce for dipping. The curly fries weren't very crispy but weren't bad once I added some season salt. My husband got a Moscow mule and said it was terrible & he wished he's stick with a beer instead.\\nThe thing is, like others have said, the service was bad. Remarkably bad. We sat at the bar on the \\\"outside\\\" and there were two servers covering the bar. One server couldn't be bothered at all. She stood at the cash register and ignored customers completely. It was like none of us were even there... really it was bizarre. She did, however, say \\\"bye\\\" and \\\"thank you\\\" to everyone when they left... yeah, weird. The other server was more attentive, but hardly. She brought us everything we asked for but never checked on us once. She stood around ignoring customers as well and sipped some tea. When we were finished eating we kind of sat there for a while and waited for one of them to notice us... but we ultimately just waved the more attentive server down for some boxes and the check. I guess if you really want wings & aren't looking forward to the tacky \\\"Hooters experience\\\" you would be better off getting take out.Very good, wings were good as usual, waitress was extremely slow, and she checked on us about every 30 minutes. Ceaser salad was EXTRODANARY!!! If you've never been to a hooters u may not want to come with children under 12Me, hubbie and our two kids decided to eat here after waiting forever at Cappy's. We sat at the bar since that was first come first serve in order to avoid a 20-30 min wait time. We ordered boneless wings, breaded bone in wings and a fried grouper sandwich. The food was taking a lot longer than we hoped for to come out so we asked to take it to go as soon as it came out. The food could have used more \\\"seasoning\\\" or salt however the grouper sandwich was HUGE and pretty juicy considering. Servers were cute and friendly, but overall wait time is too long for such a high demand tourist area.I have been to many Hooters locations over the years. This one should be good it's on Clearwater Beach, but loud noisy service was off. Seems the chain is not what it use to be. So many wing companies now, you have to do a good job or it gets worse.All right so this Hooters is the more of a touristy hooters. So the food was mediocre for even for Hooters. The burgers was a little overcooked and you can't order an extra patty suck for us keto people.  But some of the girls are way above average in the looks department so they got that.Great place to catch a football game, enjoy some wings, and great bartenders! Carolyn was awesome today! She recommended the Daytona wings and they did not disappoint. Gotta hit the original Hooters when in Clearwater!Writing this in hopes that corporate reads. Only reason for four stars is I did not try the food so could not review. Came in for a beer during COVID (9pm an hour before close on a Thursday evening). Staff was amazing! They were working together as a team. Bouncing between tables attending to every table and cleaning each moment in between. The manager on duty Orin was managing and working with his staff (working as a leader and teacher). Courtney our bartender was was on top! Thank you for the great service. Keep it up!Boneless chicken wings with hooters sauce is a must with fries (shareable). The burger not such a great hit texture of the meat wasn't good. Great vibes and cute staff. Ac inside could use updatingThe food was great, the service needed worked on bad!!!! Took forever to get drinks, the food came out semi hot.\\nPlace was nice n clean, it was ur typical hooters girls walking around in there orange shorts n white top\\\"\\\"\\\"\\\"\\nNuthin special.We've been here before because we are locals. Sometimes we stay out at the beach for a weekend and when we do, we have gone here to watch sports and have some wings. \\n\\nI've never had any issues with this location as far as service or food. I have to say that I am reviewing this time and giving them a 4 because I think they do a good job with their social distancing of tables, cleaning, masking of staff, etc. \\n\\nOur server was great, didn't come around too much or too little, our food came out hot and correct. The staff tuned the tvs to the channel of the Lightning game for us. No complaints at all... in fact we went to dinner at an upscale place the following night and it sucked. Should have gone back to Hooters, lolJoe the manager had the worst customer service I had ever experienced.   He also definitely trained Alana the hostess to act the same way. Joe continued to tell us that he is going to seat a party of 20 ahead of us (the party of 20 called while we were waiting for 45 minutes already and they werent even there), then Joe continued to say if we sit anywhere before we are seated he will instruct wait staff not to serve us.  Where is hospitality nowadays.  We are on spring break with our kids and grandkids and get treated like this.  Highly dissapointed.  We were a group of 9 and we already have told several family and friends and social media outlets. I have looked at the ratings and seen Joe and Alanas names both mentioned several times.  You might want to get new training and employees in the Clearwater locationGoodness gracious the worst service! I went to this location and we were greeted and seated, then waited 15-20 minutes before we even saw our server. When she finally came it seemed like she was a bit annoyed, took our order. Once our food was brought out we were missing an order of wings, a pitcher of beer and another drink. It took another 10-15 minutes to notify someone of the missing items. It was just a horrible dinning experience, overall. Service was awful, I wanted to speak to someone to remove the auto 18% gratuity on our bill, but it took too long for the waitress to even come back to the table I gave up.We were on the trip of a lifetime to Clearwater Beach\\nAnd we stopped at Hooters. We had a tall girl Alex who made us feel special and had a sincere interest in us. What a great experience and the food was terrific.What should be a showcase 5 star Hooters is an embarrasment to the Hooters chain. It basically boils down to a manager that NEEDS to be replaced with better personal skills .. tyrant and condescending to his employees. Rude and arrogant to customers. The good waitresses quit....and as a former server myself, I'd quit too. A new competent GM could vastly increase profits with a happy face, encoragement gets far better performance then criticism....especially in front of customers. Just my observations.my party and i came from clearwater beach wearing shorts shoes and bathing suit tops ... u would think this is what HOOTERS ..(a place that caters to beach comers) welcomes , yet the manager kicked us out for wearing bathing suit tops . and my waitress said she does this often and licks people out ... we will NEVER come back and i will tell my friends not to come here . don't be so stuck up when your running a business like this ! on the BEACH ( our waitress was nice though)Good food. Bad service.\\nI love hooters so I say this with sadness.\\nBirds (and their fecal matter) all over the outside tables and chairs; even attempted to steal our food. Sit inside and maybe the service and atmosphere may be better \\u200dI ordered two times and both times I was disappointed. The order was completely wrong. Food was cold. Don't order food from Hooters Clearwater. They not doing their job.We were on the trip of a lifetime to Clearwater Beach\\nAnd we stopped at Hooters. We had a tall girl Alex who made us feel special and had a sincere interest in us. What a great experience and the food was terrific.Great location, servers are nice, but manager is a total jerk-wad.  I do sunset photography and have posted dozens of nice photos to their page, which I know they liked, but every time I come here, this guy goes out of his way to claim I'm surreptitiously \\\"filming\\\" the clientele or crew, because my camera is on the table.  I have no idea what he's got against me, but he's a jerk.  Other than that, I'd recommend the place, besides the totally anal-retentive manager who looks like he's 11 years old and clearly has a Napoleonic complex.My family and I were out walking the strip and decided to dine here. We've been to a lot of Hooters, but this one was dealt nice.I went in last night, aroumd 8:30pm.. I ordered my kids cheeseburgers. What came out was pathetic.  I wouldn't feed that to my dog. When I asked for something else, they told me the kitchen was closed. So now I have to hunt down something else at 9:30 for them to eat.tWent here for dinner with my family down at Clearwater Beach. Amazing view from the second and third story! We sat on the second story and ate and had a good view of the sunset. \\nOrdered the buffalo shrimp for an appetizer with medium sauce and it was delicious! \\nThen had naked wings in medium and was very good as well! Medium is not spicy at all and just right for me! (I don't do spicy/hot food)\\nMy son had the kids meal with Mac n cheese and tater tots with chocolate milk ($5) and plenty of food! The Mac n cheese is Kraft and the elbow noodles (he's picky and loved it!) it also came on a frisbee \\\"plate\\\" which was awesome, my son played frisbee all night and was super excited! \\nGreat service and continued to come back and check on us! Perfect setting and atmosphere for a night out on the beach.Great food as well as great service. Me and the family had a fun time getting to chill at this spot. Our servers name was Katelin and she was kind and very attentive with whatever we needed. \\n\\nOur favorite dish was the 20 piece boneless wings. HIGHLY recommend it as an appetizer. The drink I had (Mango Mojito) was delicious as well. Will defiantly be coming backI sat down in the bar to have some drinks and a bite to eat. The server at the bar that attended me to took my drink, my order of food and proceeded to walk away. I finished my drink and when i tried to grab her attention for another, she neglected me. Walked around a few times before looking my way, and when she finalyly looked my way i was fed up so i asked to be sat outside. She got upset because i mumbled some things in Spanish and disrespectfully said Hijo Puta to me. I asked for the check, she had already closed me out BEFORE this incident. That's when i realized she just wasn't trying to do her job. She called her manager over, i explained it to him and they escorted me sit elsewhere. While waiting on my food, the manager walks over to me and says i can't order anything else and after the food i have to leave. Horrible experience. I personally won't be eating here again.This hooters was top notch and the bartender Carolyn was awesome and treated us with tremendous conversation and was very attentive. Felt like actual normalcy since covid. The rest of the staff was friendly as well and down to earth. The manager at this location should be extremely proud of his staff. Clearwater Beach Hooters rocks!!!!!Don't get me wrong; I love the views at Hooters. But my experience last night was the pits.  Our server offered drinks.  Moments later, another server came by to ask if we'd been helped.  When told \\\"yes\\\" she told me the other server stole her table, and wanted me to describe what she looks like. I am not into all that drama.  I just want to eat.\\n   Later, our original server apologized about being a bad \\\"waitress\\\" and explained that a bus boy had thrown away her receipts that detailed her tips.  Hold on, it gets worse.  When I gave her $20 for my $16 tab, she left, then returned, asking, do you need change?  I said \\\"yes\\\" and left her $2.\\n    Again, I am a Hooters fan, but this place scores low in the \\\"satisfaction\\\" category.We got there and waited a lot time for our waiter, then when we ordered we waited 30 mins for our food!!!! Ridiculous and our waiter wasn't even apologetic about it! Our wings and nachos were cold ! Disappointed.Came here with my best friend from NYC. Our bartender was Kendall she's absolutely stunning and sweet. The absolute most efficient bartender we have met on our time here. We love her so much. Thank you for the great time.HOTTTTTT AS HELL INSIDE. Close the doooooors!!! Wtf it's so hot inside but we stayed hoping it would cool down. The chicken tastes like butter it's actually disgusting. Bathroom no paper towels and just gross. Curly fries is the ass ends of the fries. ONE flat. Very gross. This place needs to be shut down I'm about to vomit. Never coming back. Pray for themDo not eat here, horrible service. We were literally seated by the host and once we had already ordered our food the manager came over to us and told my friend to leave because she had her bathing suit top with no shirt. This is literally a hooters RIGHT next to the beach and the hooters girls are HALF NAKED. If I could give them zeros stars I would :-)The hostesses at the front had a bad attitude and we felt really uncomfortable going in today. The only nice person there was our server on the 3rd floor after we moved up there- everyone else was so rude for no reason and catty. They were even looking my friend and I up and down. Not coming back. Such a bad experience because of their attitudes and put us in a bad mood.Came here on my birthday and sat at the bar. Our bartender was distracted by whatever was happening on her phone and her service was lacking. My girlfriend and I ended up leaving to find another bar to enjoy because that was not the spot that night. Our appetizers were delicious though and I hope whatever was bothering our bartender is resolved.Ignored by the 2 bartenders long enough for my food to get cold as I had been there 20 min and still had no napkins or silverware.  8 people at the bar and 2 bartenders....not hectic enough to warrant ignoring a basic in serving.  Then both servers kept giving attitude on the way out the door.  I would've gotten their names but they spent the whole time huddled together on 1 side.This is a super place for dirty old men.  I always feel weird in a Hooters.  I am awesomely beautiful (if only to myself!) so I don't feel threatened or intimidated by these children running around in next to nothing.  It just feels strange to be sitting there eating knowing that their sole purpose for being is so that pervs can stare at their arses hanging out of their panties (these are NOT shorts) and their ta-tas.  How do you nonchalantly eat a meal and act like that's not going on?\\n\\nThat being said, when you love a pervy old man and he wants to go to Hooters once a year, can you really say no?  I can't.  Especially if said pervy old guy is taking me on a lovely vacation to the beach.  So I suck it up and go in for lunch.  The girl children are so nice, they really are, I don't mean to bash them.  They are nice AND beautiful, how unfair is life?\\n\\nI don't drink (I'm beautiful but totally incapable of holding my liquor) so I ordered a coke.  The waitress-in-training child walks over and says \\\"did you order a Pepsi?\\\" to which I replied \\\"nope, I ordered a Coke\\\".  Beware people, this location only has Pepsi products.  I was at the beach though so I'll let this one slide.  But I will ask the question again- In locations that only have Pepsi products what do you do if someone orders a rum and Coke?  Please tell me you don't give them rum and Pepsi.  Blech!  I did try to be a trooper and drink the Pepsi but it was gross, nothing against Hooters, Pepsi just blows.  The regular waitress comes back and I ask her if she'd mind bringing me a sweet tea instead, she didn't bat an eye at my request and returned quickly with a tea.  The tea was old.  I felt like I was just being a bitch at this point if I asked for anything different so I sucked it up and drank my old tea.  It was, at least, cold and I was desperate for something.\\n\\nWe ordered boneless wings and celery, there were just great, as usual.  All kidding aside the service was great and my sweetie thoroughly enjoyed the view.  See ya next year Hooters!After I posted my previous review, I was asked to send an email to their office to speak to someone about the issues I had at Hooters. Since then I have emailed three times in over a month and have yet to get a real response, I just receive an automated \\\"We will respond shortly\\\". I don't understand why I was asked to contact them if I was not going to get a response. I frequent a lot of Hooters locations very often and will be reconsidering my next visit. Customer service is terrible and theyre just wasting my time.There may be a worse Hooters somewhere but I pity the fool who goes there.  Food sub par, girls leave a lot to be desired and service creates a vacuum (sucks). You pay a lot and get very little.  So many choices in Clearwater Beach, don't do this to yourself.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":18}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Save as csv\n","path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/data/processed/yelp_restaurant_florida_reviews.csv'\n","dat.to_csv(path, index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"M-Z2oPr5NYXJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761372685389,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":11184,"user":{"displayName":"Helen Boolean","userId":"14759417601908165916"}}},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dat.to_parquet(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/data/processed/yelp_restaurant_florida_reviews.parquet\", index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"4hOW1hxwO4g4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761376714690,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2130,"user":{"displayName":"Helen Boolean","userId":"14759417601908165916"}}},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"pxrI8_UmO1Un"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
